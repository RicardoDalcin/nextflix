# Nextflix

## A Netflix clone built with Next.js

I haven't posted anything on GitHub in a while and I feel like I've improved a lot in the past year, so I figured I'd make this project.

As this is a clone, I will mainly be implementing the UI and core functionality (navigation, previews, etc), but as the project grows I'll create mock APIs and do a bit of data fetching.

Feel free to leave any suggestions on how to improve the code structure or overall component design.
